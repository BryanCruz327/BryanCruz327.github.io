                largest city, and commercial, political, and tourist centre. The city’s name is a modification of the ancient Olisipo (Ulyssipo), 
                and its founding has been attributed to the legacy of Ulysses (Odysseus), the hero of Homer’s Odyssey; 
                to Elisha, purported to have been a grandson of the Hebrew patriarch Abraham; and, more credibly, to Phoenician colonists. 
                Lisbon owes its historical prominence to its natural harbour, one of the most beautiful in the world.
