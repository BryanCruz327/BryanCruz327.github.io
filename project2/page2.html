                <!-- 1. Why is it important for each radio button to have a unique ID? -->
                <!-- So that each button is associated to its proper input -->

                <!-- 2. How can we ensure that only one character can be selected at a time?-->
                <!-- Using radio buttons, as they only allow one input -->

                <!-- 3. What could happen if the labels aren't correctly associated with the radio buttons? -->
                <!-- If they don't all share a name, they will not be treated as a group of buttons associated to one another -->
